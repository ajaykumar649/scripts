Dear Christos, Kira, and Lovedeep,
 I read the Analysis Note on W/Z+jets -- a version
that Bryan forwarded to me last week but has date August 
10, 2009 on the cover. Here are some of my comments. Not 
all of these comments/suggestions need to go to to this 
version of the AN, but eventually  I hope these will help 
improve the documentation and the analysis.   


Abstract:
---------
  - Include the word "MadGraph, integrated pT range" (I 
    think that is what you used to make all the plots).
    Otherwise people may think that you used Pythia 
    pt-hat bins and combined them weighting by cross-section 
    to obtain the full pt spectrum, as is generally done 
    by in a typical analysis with jets.
 
 - (Optional) It may be helpful to readers if we can outline 
   here, in a sentence or two, the goal of the study along 
   the lines Rick Cavanaugh proposed in his talk a few 
   weeks ago (e.g., early data [10--50 pb^-1]: integral 
   cross-section measurement as a function of nJet; with 
   100--200 pb^-1: measurement of differential cross-section 
   in pt, etc.).


Introduction:
-------------
 - The immediate and most important use of Z+jet(s) analysis
   in the calibration of jet energy scale. Next, the W/Z+jets
   events will be used to commission missing ET, since these 
   events contain small (in case of W) or no (in case of Z) 
   real MET. 

 - Almost immediately these events will be used to tune our 
  Monte Carlo.
 
 - You can elaborate here a little bit on how these events 
  test the perturbative QCD (e.g., via sensitivity to the 
  parton distribution functions), but we can do this only with 
  very large amount of data (~ fb^-1), since the PDF uncertainties 
  are much smaller than our expected systematic uncertainty in 
  this analysis. 

 - Typically, "Introduction" section is a good place to talk 
  about some physics. For example, we can add the two 
  leading order Feynamn diagrams that give rise to W/Z+jets
  in the final state. This will elucidate why these samples 
  contain high fraction of quark-initiated jets, unlike the 
  case of QCD dijet events which are gluon dominated.


Event selection:
-----------------
sect 3.1, HLT: Are you sure that "HLT_Ele15_LW_L1R" path in the 8E29 
    menu is seeded by L1_SingleEG5 ? Last time I checked, the 
    Level-1 seed for this path was L1_SingleEG8. Please take 
    a look at:

    https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/SWGuideEgammaHLT

    Or, did you use "HLT_Ele10_LW_L1R" path, in which case 
    the rest of the text is fine ? 


section 3.2: The description of isolation and id cuts is a 
    little disorganized. If I understand the text correctly, 
    you used the same electron id cuts as in the inclusive 
    W/Z analysis (your reference 5, BTW - it should read 
    PAS EWK-09-004). If so, you should just give tables 4 and 
    5 and skip the rest of the text. Simply give reference to 
    Ref[5], where these things are explained in more detail.

    I do not understand why you do not also use the same 
    optimized electron isolation cuts as in the inclusive W/Z 
    analysis. In the inclusive analysis, we optimized the 
    id and isolation cuts together. The isolation deposits from 
    tracks, in ECAL, and in HCAL peak at different points, so 
    applying a cut on the sum of the three isolation variables 
    (your Eq. 2) doesn't make any sense, because you lose some 
    of the discrimination power. I know that such a cut 
    is V+jets group's recommendation, but it is sort of poor 
    man's cuts appropriate for, say, Higgs or SUSY searches. 
    Besides, when using such an isolation cut, the id cuts  
    from inclusive W/Z analysis (tables 4, 5) are no longer optimal.



section 3.3 Jet Reconstruction and Selection:
---------------------------------------------
 - Reference to jet algorithm is missing. A good reference would be:
   Gavin P. Salam, "Towards Jetography", arXiv:0906.1833 [hep-ph] 
   (2009).

 - It's inaccurate to say that iterative cone is computationally 
   time consuming and SISCone is not. In fact, the converse is true.
   This is part of the reason that JetMET group has made anti-kT as
   default CMS jet alogorithm.
  
 - section 3.3.2: Jet energy corrections:
   These nomenclatures are obsolete. The JEC/JetMET group doesn't 
   call corrected jets as "L2", "L3", ... etc. any more. It is 
   however true that the PAT still uses such an obsolete nomencloture 
   and sometimes and sometime has obsolete corrections applied.

 - section 3.3.3: You are NOT removing the electrons faking as jets by 
   deltaR matching. These are almost all REAL electrons. These are 
   also part of the jet collection simply because they deposit energy 
   in the calorimeter. We just remove them. The title "jet fake removal"
   is very misleading.

 - Why go select jets only in |eta| < 2.5 ? We can go upto eta = 3 in 
   this analysis. The calorimeter endcap coverage goes upto 3. It's 
   true that forward jets (in HF) aren't understood well, and we do 
   not want to go beyound 3.


section 4.1: W events:
----------------------  
Figures 22 and 23 for MET and MT for W events are missing.

Table 15: # W+1 jet events / W+0 jet events = 0.25 
          # W+2 jet events / W+1 jet events = 0.26 
          # W+3 jet events / W+2 jet events = 0.26 
          # W+4 jet events / W+3 jet events = 0.34 
         
          (from the right-most column, after all analysis cuts are applied).
          Isn't it way too high ? I would naively expect these to be 
          close to 0.12 (value of \alpha_s) -- a little smaller in fact, 
          because the electron reconstruction goes down as a function nJets.
          Do you undestand what is going on here ? Did I miss something ?
          Also, I do not understand how come you get these many 4 jet events.

         I get essentially the same ratios from Table 19.


 Figures 24 and 25 are missing.


section 4.2: Z events:
----------------------  
    
Fig 27a: Why there is a turnover (extra bump) at low pT should be explained.
         Same is true for Fig 30a, which looks more weird. Something wrong 
         here ?

Table 22: Again, # Z+ (N+1) jets / # Z+N jets = 0.25
          Again the same question ?

        We expect a value close to 0.1. See, for example, the CDF 
        plot in there final Z(ee)+ jets paper, which was published 
        last year in PRL:

        http://www-cdf.fnal.gov/physics/new/qcd/zjets_08/N_N-1_ratio.gif

       The reference for this paper is:
       T. Aaltonen et al. (CDF Collaboration), Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 102001 (2008) 

  That's all I have.

Kalanand
