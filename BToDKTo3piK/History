Started working on penalty fit in dpiFit.cc

V00-03-42 Frank 14 June 2006
Remove the remaining hardcoded BR's from BdkOnResNLLYields.
All constants are now set in numEvts.par.

V00-03-41 Frank 12 June 2006

V00-03-39 Abi 07 June 2006
Added setVerbose() in BdkPdfDKDalitz, passed on to BdkDDalitzAmp.
Added more verbosity in BdkOnResNLLYields.

BdkDDalitzAmp: Only renormalizing if change in mass or width is less 
than 5% of the width. However, on-demand normalization doesn't currently work 
due to the symmetrization of the norm matrix. Will fix if want to later.


V00-03-38 Frank 06 June 2006
Add option to BdkPdfOnRes::generate() that allows to 
fluctuate B+ and B- yields separately.

Added analysis/fitWYields.cc and removed it from toy/
Many developments in analysis/plotNLL.cc


V00-03-27 Abi 28 May 2006
Added class BdkOnResNLLYields.

BdkPdfOnRes: Removed blinding. Added methods to set nsig and asym from 
CP parameters. Added x and y accessors.

globals/setupPdfs.cc: removed blinding var from pdfOnResDK init.

utils/fit.cc: Added penalty (yields) NLL

Added analysis/plotNLL.cc and removed analysis/plotNorms.cc (superceded)

utils/printFitResult.cc: fit result print is now not verbose, so as 
not to print all the fixed vars, of which we have about 2000...

params/numEvts.par: set the asymmetry and nsig errors to what comes
out of the DE-q'-d' fit.

Added toy/fitWYields.cc


V00-03-26 Abi 25 May 2006
BdkDDalitzAmp: Denominator in spinFactor is now mAB^2 = the invariant mass
squared of the daughters of the resonance. It was previously set to the 
mass of the peak of the resonance, based on CLEO's Kpipi0 paper, 
PRD 63 0902001. Talking to the paper's author, Dave Asner, he says that 
using mAB^2 is probably more correct, but that the difference is small.
Anyway, doing it this way enables us to add p-wave nonres terms
A static flag enables us to turn this on or off (but with recompilation).

Added 3 p-wave nonres terms.

Fixed a bug in on-demand renormalization, which caused only diagonal terms 
to be recalculated.

Created params/peak-mass and moved the 4 Dalitz files there.

Recalculated norm parameters in dalitzNorm.par and in dstar.par 
with the mAB^2 spin factor.

Added the p-wave nonres parameters to dalitzN.par, dalitzP.par, and dstar.par.




V00-03-25 Abi 25 May 2006
Added analysis/plotNorms.cc. 
BdkDDalitzAmp: Added p-wave nonres components

V00-03-24 Abi 24 May 2006

amplitude following an evaluate() call. Also providing normOverNoCP()
normalization ratio over no-CP case.

V00-03-22 Frank 16 May 2006
Fix bug in BdkDDalitzAmp (rho- was decaying into pi0 pi+)

V00-03-21 Abi 13 May 2006
Recycling rho*+ mass and width for rho*- and rho*0.

V00-03-20 Abi 13 May 2006
Added f0(1500), f0(1700), and f2'(1525) states.

BdkDDalitzAmp:
- masses and widths of resonances are now RRV's and can be changed.
- calNorm() now has the behavior that, when called with default 2nd 
  argument (kTRUE), it enforces normalization of full norm matrices. 
  This is same as old behavior.
- when 2nd argument is kFALSE, normalizes only the rows and columns
  that need normalizing, determined by whether _massRes (_widthRes)
  and _massResLast (_widthResLast) are identical or not.
- Usual printout every 1/10th of the events is given only when 
  2nd argument is kTRUE (default).
- Verbosity flag "n" (can be set directly or by giving it to the wrapper
  with additional flag "+") prints additional normalization info for the
  individual resonances that require normalization.
- the getamp() function now automatically normalizes the resonances that
  require it.

analysis/plotComponents.cc made smarter.


V00-03-19 Abi 09 May 2006
Fixed excited rho- naming convention and added rho(1700) to plotComponents.

V00-03-18 Abi 09 May 2006
Added rho(1700) states, also analysis/compareNorms.csh.
Also, Frank added a function to change N2 cuts. 

V00-03-17 Abi 09 May 2006
Slightly changed rho mass (.7755 to .7758) to conform to PDG.
Added f0(1370) to analysis/plotComponents.cc. 
Added params/plotComponents.par.

parameters after adding f0 and f2.

V00-03-11 Abi 05 May 2006
Added f0 and f2 resonances. f0 given width of 70 MeV. PDF says it's between 
40 and 100.

V00-03-10 Abi 05 May 2006
Added fitFractions() function

V00-03-09 Abi 03 May 2006

V00-00-29 Abi 12 Dec 2005
But fix in BdkDDalitzAmp::calNorm(): previously didn't divide the 
normalization coefficients by the # of toy events.

updates and fixes in 
kumac/bgdDalitzSB.kumac
kumac/chainhbk.kumac
kumac/cuts.kumac

globals/cuts.hh: added mixneumass cut to cutBasic.


V00-00-28 Abi 10 Dec 2005
Cleanup in cuts.hh, also added new cuts
cutPiVT("very tight pi PID", "Pippidbit==15&&Pimpidbit==15");
cutPiT("tight pi PID", "Pippidbit>6&&Pimpidbit>6");
cutNN("cutNN", "nnout>0.1&&bknnout>0.25");

In vars.hh, Kmpidbit replaced by Pimpidbit (similarly Kp by Pip).


V00-00-27 Abi 10 Dec 2005
Added utils/chargeCut.cc and analysis/mixNeuMassStudy.cc

V00-00-26 Abi 9 Dec 2005
vars.hh and setupVars.cc: Added variable mixneumass, the Kpi inv mass.
read.cc: fixed some coding problems.
setupChains.cc: SmallN is now defined from workdir, not BToDKTo3piK.

V00-00-25 Frank 6 Dez 2005
Implemented Dalitz comparison of data and MC

V00-00-24 Abi 3 Dec 2005
BdkDDalitzAmp now has a static registry, used to normalize all objects
with the static function normalizeAll().


V00-00-23 Abi 3 Dec 2005
Changed m12 and m13 to RooAbsReal from RooRealVar in the constructors
of some Dalitz PDF wrappers.

BdkPdfAbsBase now has a static dependents list, set from the outside
by the user (in globals/setupVars.cc). This is necessary in order to
keep out of the parameters() set any RRV's that feed into
RooFormulaVars that are given as the dependents of a PDF.

globals/setupPdefs.cc: used to crash when reading parameters with
paramsPath() + "eff.par". This is fixed by expanding paramsPath().
Not a good solution, but works in the meanwhile. The crash is in the
parameters reading, not the PDF. Also, the crash doesn't occur when
doing the read outside of the script files. Strange.


V00-00-22 Abi 3 Dec 2005
Added BdkDalitzEff.rdl (forgot to do last tag)

V00-00-21 Abi 3 Dec 2005
Added some Dalitz PDFs to globals/pdfs.hh and setupPdfs.cc.

V00-00-20 Abi 3 Dec 2005
BdkDalitzBase now has a static efficiency function. It is currently
used by all resonances, butnot by the non-resonant component.

BdkDalitzBase subclass constructors now have a default D0 flavor.

Some bug fixes in clean use of flavor from the base class
(previously had some leftovers where it was also handled by 
subclasses). 


V00-00-19 Abi 1 Dec 2005
BdkDDalitz::evaluate() and BdkDKDalitz::evaluate() no longer call inDalitz().
This is now done by BdkDDalitzAmp::getamp().

BdkDalitzBase.rdl: Flavor is now D0=-1, D0BAR=1, to correspond to the
K change in the dominant B decay.

BdkPdfDKDalitz: _phase is not a RooAbsReal, not RooRealVar, so it can
be supplied from the outside as a RooFormulaVar.


V00-00-18 Abi 1 Dec 2005
BdkDDalitzAmp.cc: Fixed bugs in the assignment of trackinfo and its use
in spinFactor(), which resulted in some bad symptons: we couldn't
get the CLEO distribution with their parameters, and plots of m12%m13,
m13%m23, m23%m12 didn't all look the same when the resonances had equal
phases and amplitudes. With this fix, both these problems go away, as 
long as we use the rho- phase CLEO had in their hep-ex/0306048 V1,
which was -4 degrees, rather than the one in PRD 72, 031102, which is
176. It seems that they changed some definition by 180 degrees, as Ben
has observed in the past. 

V00-00-17 Frank 1 Dec 2005
Fix initialization bug in Bdk2DpolyDalitz PDF

V00-00-16 Abi 1 Dec 2005
Fixed flavor-flipping but in BdkDDalitz::evaluate().
Modified BdkDDalitzAmp::calNorm().

V00-00-15 Frank 30 Nov 2005
Add sym/asym parametrization to Bdk2DpolyDalitz class
Make BdkPdf2DpolyDalitz use this parametrization by default
Changed some RooRealVar's to RooAbsReal's

V00-00-14 Abi 29 Nov 2005
Some cleanup in Dalitz PDFs: kCharge converted to BdkDalitzBase::Flavor.

BdkDDalitzAmp's normalization parameters are now part of the PDF parameters,
so they can be read in from the par files.

Added phase input to BdkPdfDKDalitz so we can handle delta +/- gamma later.


V00-00-13 Abi 25 Nov 2005
bug fixes in dataMCSBCompare.cc, added R2Frame plot to plots.hh

V00-00-12 Abi 23 Nov 2005
Bug fixes in Bdk2DpolyDalitz.cc, chains.hh, and setupChains.cc.

Bug fix in params names in BdkPdf2DpolyDalitz. Moved old params/ files to params/old/.


V00-00-04 Abi 4 Nov 2005
BdkPdfAbsBase::initParameters() is no longer abstract, since many 
subclasses don't implement it as a separate function.

V00-00-03 Abi 4 Nov 2005
Many updates to Dalitz PDFs and wrappers

V00-00-02 Abi 24 Oct 2005
